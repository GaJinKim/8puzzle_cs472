# 8puzzle cs472
Lab 1 Assignment for CS 472

**Algorithms Implemented:**
1. BFS
2. IDS
3. A* (misplaced tile heuristic)
4. A* (manhattan distance heuristic)
5. A* (custom weighted misplaced tile heuristic)

**Instructions:**
1. Clone repository
2. Run Main (8puzzle_cs472/src/Main.java)
3. Program will ask for file path (e.g. ./puzzles/Part2/S2.txt)
4. Program will ask for algorithm (e.g. BFS/IDS/h1/h2/h3)
